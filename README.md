# Module 3 Challenge for UNC Chapel Hill Coding Boot Camp

## Password Generator 

In this project I was given a starter code with the task of adding javascript.  The goal of the project was to have a random password generator that uses window 
prompts to ask the user how long they would like their password to be and which type(s) of characters they would like to include.

## Conclusions

What I took away from this project is the importance of console logging actions in javascript as I build code.  Had I properly done this initially I would have 
more than likely avoided a complication related to syntax with the .concat() function.  I also used this project to gain a better understanding of the structuring of javascript files and how to more effectively read them.
